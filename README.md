1. Credit_card_fraud_detection --->
   
   This Credit_card machine learning project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest to detect credit card fraud. It tackles class imbalance with oversampling, fine-tunes models using GridSearchCV, and evaluates performance through recall, ROC-AUC, and precision-recall curves for high fraud detection accuracy.


3. 📩 SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning -->
   
  This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as SPAM or HAM (Legitimate). It uses natural language processing techniques and various classifiers to accurately detect spam messages.

  📁 Dataset : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
  Problem Statement : Classify a given SMS message as **spam** or **ham** using traditional ML       models trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
