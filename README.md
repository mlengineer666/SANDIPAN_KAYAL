1. Credit_card_fraud_detection --->
   
   This Credit_card machine learning project uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest to detect credit card fraud. It tackles class imbalance with oversampling, fine-tunes models using GridSearchCV, and evaluates performance through recall, ROC-AUC, and precision-recall curves for high fraud detection accuracy.

   📁 Dataset : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)
   Problem Statement : Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

2. 📩 SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning -->
   
  This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as SPAM or HAM (Legitimate). It uses natural language processing techniques and various classifiers to accurately detect spam messages.

  📁 Dataset : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
  Problem Statement : Classify a given SMS message as SPAM or HAM using traditional ML models trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.


3.🎬 Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning

   This project pioneers a cutting-edge machine learning model designed to accurately classify movies into their respective genres using textual descriptions, particularly plot summaries. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a diverse array of classifiers, this model offers a powerful and automated solution for predicting a movie's genre with precision and reliability.

Problem Statement :
Given a movie description, predict the correct genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, etc.) using traditional machine learning models.
