            "10 ::: Press (2011) ::: Press is a story of young people overwhelmed by social discord and their surroundings. The film concisely depicts multiple factors underlying this situation. These are things that could affect any of us. People tend to clam up and stop communicating when depressed or upset. It is also not uncommon for people to note the expression on an individual's face and decide to leave them alone, even if the individual concerned does not actually consider their problem to be serious. The events in this film are no exaggeration. Rather, they are emblematic of a modern disease, in which a family and those surrounding it slip into a negative momentum. How to address the problem of communication breakdown is a question with great value and meaning for contemporary society.\n"

But Tina's grandfather, who has a modern outlook towards life, proposes a \\\"trial marriage\\\" for two months where they will have to live within Anil's meagre means. They can spend the day together but at nights Anil returns to his home. Both Anil and Tina agree to this, as they are confident their love will overcome any challenges along the way. Their families are sceptical but agree to the arrangement. As expected, a lot of challenges do come the way of both Anil and Tina during this \\\"trial marriage\\\". Do they survive these ?

As a fan of jazz music, Fred Poulet (film director) decided to follow him during his three years residency for an intriguing documentary. The concept is that on one hand you can never see the artist speaking about himself and on the other hand Fred Poulet is interviewing original characters of Coutances, the city where the festival takes place.

Mysteriously, Spencer gets recruited into a cult-like street sales company. He apparently has left high school behind as he begins a meteoric rise in the company and becomes engulfed in the bizarre culture full of raucous sales speeches and shady street deals. Spencer starts rolling in cash. He buys a classic Chevelle, starts suiting up and meets a stunning brunette with whom he begins a torrid love affair. Brandon, a troublemaker friend from the other side of the tracks can't be bothered with all that \\\"motivational shit\\\" and \\\"rah rah bitch slap hoopla.\\\" So he starts robbing houses and dealing drugs small time. His small crew turns into a profitable enterprise due to the mentorship of Avi Solomon, a sixty-year-old Jewish diamond smuggler. Over time tension builds between the two friends as they become successful and try to recruit each other into each other's worlds. Brandon's crew becomes famous and dubbed \\\"The James Bond Gang\\\" by New York media, happy to report on the slick crew's activities on a daily basis. Things come to a dangerous head as Spencer agrees to come to a \\\"party\\\" at a crime compound and plans to give Brandon the definitive refusal of the offer to join the crime gang. Brandon, Avi Solomon and a group of drugged-out thugs disapprove. Things get physical. Five years later Suzanne, one of Brandon's and Spencer's high school friends, leaves a gathering of some of the high school gang, and arrives home to find out that her mansion has been broken into, an obvious victim of the James Bond Gang.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
